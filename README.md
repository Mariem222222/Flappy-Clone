The Flappy Clone project is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using JavaScript and HTML. This project includes the core game mechanics such as player controls, obstacles, and scoring. It serves as a great example for those looking to learn about game development and JavaScript programming. The repository contains all necessary files, including `index.html` for the game layout and `game.js` for the game logic.
